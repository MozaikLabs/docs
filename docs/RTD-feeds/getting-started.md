# Getting Started

The **Real-Time Data (RTD) Feeds** offered by Mozaik Labs are tailored for high-demand, event-driven applications that require immediate data delivery. RTD Feeds operate by fetching and verifying data in real-time, enabling decentralized applications to respond instantly to external events.

## How RTD Feeds Work

1. **Event Monitoring**: Mozaik’s RTD operators continuously monitor predefined events or data sources, ensuring readiness to respond as soon as an update is requested.

2. **Instant Computation and Proof**: Upon request, the operator retrieves the necessary data and generates a zk-proof to confirm accuracy of computation done.

3. **Immediate On-Chain Submission**: The data, along with its proof, is sent to a coordinator contract. The RTD Coordinator contract verifies the proof, and upon successful verification, directs the data to the intended smart contract, enabling real-time decision-making.

## Use Cases

RTD Feeds are well-suited for applications that need rapid data response times, such as:

- **Perp Markets**: Real-time price updates for perpetual markets.
- **Outcome Markets**: Instant updates on scores and outcomes for betting applications.
- **Custom Integrations**: Contact us for custom RTD Feeds tailored to your specific needs.

With Mozaik’s RTD Feeds, developers can integrate truly real-time data into their smart contracts, enabling fast and secure decision-making for time-sensitive applications.
